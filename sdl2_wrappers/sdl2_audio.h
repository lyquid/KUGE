  * Calls Mix_CloseAudio, which shutdowns and cleanups the mixer API.
  * After calling this all audio is stopped, the device is closed, and the SDL_mixer 
  * functions should not be used. You may, of course, use Mix_OpenAudio to start
  * the functionality again.
  * Note: This function doesn't do anything until you have called it the same number 
  * of times that you called Mix_OpenAudio. You may use Mix_QuerySpec to find out 
  * how many times Mix_CloseAudio needs to be called before the device is actually 
  * closed.
  * 
  * Also calls Mix_Quit any needed times.
  * This function cleans up all dynamically loaded library handles, freeing memory. 
  * If support is required again it will be initialized again, either by Mix_Init 
  * or loading a sample or some music with dynamic support required. You may call 
  * this function when Mix_Load functions are no longer needed for the MIX_INIT_* 
  * formats. You should call this function for each time Mix_Init was called, otherwise 
  * it may not free all the dynamic library resources until the program ends. This 
  * is done so that multiple unrelated modules of a program may call Mix_Init and 
  * Mix_Quit without affecting the others performance and needs.

  /**
  * Initialize the mixer API.
  * This must be called before using other functions in this library (SDL_Mixer).
  * SDL must be initialized with SDL_INIT_AUDIO before this call. frequency would 
  * be 44100 for 44.1KHz, which is CD audio rate. Most games use 22050, because 
  * 44100 requires too much CPU power on older computers. chunk_size is the size 
  * of each mixed sample. The smaller this is the more your hooks will be called. 
  * If make this too small on a slow system, sound may skip. If made too large, 
  * sound effects will lag behind the action more. You want a happy medium for 
  * your target computer. You also may make this 4096, or larger, if you are just 
  * playing music. MIX_CHANNELS(8) mixing channels will be allocated by default. 
  * You may call this function multiple times, however you will have to call Mix_CloseAudio 
  * just as many times for the device to actually close. The format will not changed 
  * on subsequent calls until fully closed. So you will have to close all the way 
  * before trying to open with different format parameters.
  * @param freq Output sampling frequency in samples per second (Hz). You might 
  *             use MIX_DEFAULT_FREQUENCY(22050) since that is a good value for most games.
  * @param format Output sample format.
  * @param channels Number of sound channels in output. Set to 2 for stereo, 1 
  *                   for mono. This has nothing to do with mixing channels.
  * @param chunk_size Bytes used per output sample.
  * @return True on success, or false on errors.
